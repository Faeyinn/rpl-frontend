# TODO: Add Motion Animations to Landing Page

## Tasks
- [x] Update components/landing/DecorativeIcons.tsx: Add fade-in and floating animations to icons and circles
- [x] Update components/landing/BackgroundPattern.tsx: Add subtle animations to gradients and grid
- [x] Update components/landing/HelpButton.tsx: Add hover animations and enhance existing fade-in
- [x] Test animations by running dev server and checking landing page

## Notes
- Use 'motion/react' for consistency with MainCard.tsx
- Ensure animations are subtle and enhance UX without being distracting
- Animations should start after page load with staggered delays
